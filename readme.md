### ROBET ‚Äì Decentralized AI-Powered Betting Platform

---

## **Introduction**  
ROBET is a decentralized, AI-powered betting platform designed to empower users to create and participate in bets on **any event**. Unlike traditional platforms like Polymarket, ROBET removes the restrictions of whitelisting and human resolvers, enabling **real-time, scalable, and transparent betting**.

## How we do it?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant R as Robet (AI on Twitter)
    participant SC as Solana Contract
    participant AI as ChatGPT & Gemini

    U->>R: Tweet with broadcast link + question (e.g. "Will there be a goal?")
    R->>R: Analyze feasibility of creating a bet
    alt Feasible?
        R->>SC: Deploy new bet contract on Solana
        R->>U: Reply with Solana bet link
    else Not Feasible
        R->>U: Decline or provide reason
    end
    U->>SC: Place bets using SOL
    note over U,SC: Users place their wagers until the bet closes

    par Event Ends
        R->>R: Retrieve relevant video/audio feed
        R->>AI: Analyze outcome (e.g. "Was a goal scored?")
        AI->>R: Provide resolution result
        R->>SC: Resolve bet contract on Solana
        SC->>U: Distribute payouts to winners
    end

## **Features**  
### 1. **Seamless Bet Creation**  
- Users create bets by sharing a broadcast link (e.g., sports matches, political speeches) with a question like:  
  *‚ÄúWill a goal be scored in the next minute?‚Äù*  
- ROBET analyzes the feasibility and deploys a **smart contract bet** on the **Solana blockchain**, providing users with a **Solana Blink** link for participation.  

### 2. **AI-Powered Resolution**  
- ROBET retrieves video or audio feeds post-event and uses AI models like **ChatGPT** and **Gemini APIs** to determine outcomes.  
- Winners receive their rewards instantly via blockchain, ensuring transparency and speed.  

### 3. **Incentivized Bet Creators**  
- ROBET rewards bet creators, introducing a **creator economy** for interactive, engaging bets.  
- Content creators can add live bets during streams to enhance audience engagement.  

### 4. **Decentralized and Scalable**  
- Smart contracts ensure trustless execution and payout.  
- AI handles a large volume of custom, short-term bets without delays.

## **How It Works**  

### **Step 1: Creating a Bet**  
1. Tweet a broadcast link (e.g., a YouTube stream or sports match) with your question.  
2. ROBET evaluates the question‚Äôs feasibility in real time.  
3. If valid, ROBET creates a **smart contract** and replies with a **Solana Blink** for user participation.  

### **Step 2: Joining a Bet**  
1. Participants click on the Solana Blink and join the bet using **SOL tokens**.  
2. Funds are held in the smart contract until the event resolves.

### **Step 3: Resolving the Bet**  
1. Once the event ends, ROBET retrieves relevant feeds.  
2. AI (using **ChatGPT** and **Gemini APIs**) determines the result.  
3. Winners are automatically awarded their share of the pot directly to their wallets.
